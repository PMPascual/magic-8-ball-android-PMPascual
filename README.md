# Android 8-ball Application

# Introduction

This is my magic 8-ball application.  I used some free assets and what knowledge I gained so far to implement nested layouts
as well as how to link imageViews and Buttons to java code.  I also reinforced knowledge of Java and O-O programming.

# Installation

To install, please clone the repository, open Android Studio, and open this project.  From there you can build and run on either
an emulator an attached Android phone.
